            <p class="para">It’s the next big breakthrough in technology. It’s a joke. It’s a marketing strategy. It’s a
                techno-dystopian nightmare. It’s the <strong>metaverse</strong> — defined most simply as a virtual world
                where people can socialize, work, and play — and Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes it is the future 
                of the internet and of his trillion-dollar company.Although “metaverse” became a buzzword after Facebook
                changed its company nameto <strong><em>“Meta”</em></strong> last month, many people are still trying to
                understand what exactly the metaverse is and whether the futuristic technological concept is something  
                they should take seriously.Many critics and skeptics have mocked Zuckerberg’s plan to change Facebook 
                from a social media company to a metaverse company. Some critics say that by focusing on the metaverse 
                and renaming itself while the company is reeling from a PR crisis, Facebook is distracting from the 
                problems it creates or contributes to in the real world: issues like harming teens’ mental health, 
                facilitating the spread of disinformation, and fueling political polarization.</p>
